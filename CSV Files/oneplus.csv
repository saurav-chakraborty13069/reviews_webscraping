9,oneplus,Rahul Saha,5,Highly recommended,"Hi, guys don't think twice, just go for it.   Battery capacity 3700 mah but don't think it's less it goes 3days on normal use(social media, call, bit gaming, few photos). Because it has inbilt dark mode which reduces the battery consumption.   Power # it's a BEAST.  you can feel it, I was doing research for 2months  before buying it but at last I brought it coz in every way OnePlus 7 wins.Camera 5/5Speed. 5/5Design. 5/5Battery. 5/5Worthy. 5/5"
