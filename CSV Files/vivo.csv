6,vivo,Sanjay Jethe,5,Brilliant,"Under 20k it's a good option, overall getting satisfied performance.Display Quality is best at this price range.Fun Touch OS having better touch than Color OS and MI UI"
7,vivo,Benson Antony,5,Highly recommended,"I clearly knew abt Z1x and XT, yet I chose Vivo.. I just wanted a trusted brand as I'm investing 17k.. In YouTube and Online sitesthey are only boosting relme.. I really think those are heavy paid reviews.. if u observe closely u will realise it.. I'm going with my experience.. not by just word of mouth and I'm delighted with the first impression itself.. using more than 22hrs I feel Z1x is value for money!"
8,vivo,Kumar Vikramaditya,3,Nice,Excellent photography in day light and more than good in night from both front and back camera. Good battery. Good sAmoled screen and Funtouch UI but not better than samsung sAmoled screen and ONE UI. Need some improvement in UI and add more amoled supported function like samsung ONE UI. Excellent flash charging much much better than every phone in this range.

On screen fingerprint sensor work like butter & even faster than most of rear fingerprint sensors5. Usually I don't review any product after purchase but this time I thought that when I want to purchase any product then my first priority will be Rev..."
